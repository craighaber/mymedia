- login with email
- seperate sign up page to avoid confusion

Table ideas
USE AG GRID community and override styles with my own, easiest and best solution
- might not need pagination, see how MAL does it
- could scroll like notes app
- stil would want search and filter by category
- would want ability to click on a row and view/edit/delete it
- would be good to have extended notes per media too
