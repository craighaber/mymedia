- only log errors in dev mode
- figure out what to do with multiple rows with same title, if anything (the rows are keyed by title in the html table)
- login with email
- seperate sign up page to avoid confusion

Table ideas
- might not need pagination, see how MAL does it
- could scroll like notes app
- stil would want search and filter by category
- would want ability to click on a row and view/edit/delete it
- would be good to have extended notes per media too
